# c-sharp-unit-test-challenge
Small c# unit test challenge

### Requirements - C# IDE & .NET CORE 3.1 SDK

#### Purposefully bad code and currently not possible to unit test

#### Your challenge is to make this code better, simpler and most of all testable

#### There are some unit tests already written, don't not change those tests. Just make them pass

#### Those tests along with the SnowShop.App are the Spec. But do not rely on the App to help you to pass the tests 

#### There is a mock API. So assume the data is not always the same. It will also never give you the values you need to pass the tests
#### Using the mock API can be found [here](https://docs.mockend.com/). The basics are already added for you

#### If you choose to make more tests, choose any one of the naming convention for the unit tests explain in [here](https://dzone.com/articles/7-popular-unit-test-naming)

### I wish you luck
